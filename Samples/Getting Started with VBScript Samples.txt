==================================
== How to use VBScript Examples ==
==================================

1. Register the ActiveX version of DebenuPDFLibraryLite0916.dll.

You need to register the ActiveX library with Windows, using the following command:

regsvr32 <path>\DebenuPDFLibraryLite0916.dll

2. In order to easily run the examples, you will need to associate .vbs files with wscript.exe. You can do this by doing the following:

- Right-click on a .vbs file and select 'Open with > Choose default program'.
- click on the 'Browse...' button and navigate your way to 'C:\Windows\system32'.
- Select the 'wscript.exe' file and click on OK.

.vbs files should now open cscript.exe when they are double-clicked on.

3. Double-click on any of the .vbs examples to see them in action.

PLEASE NOTE: IN WINDOWS VISTA, 7 AND 8 YOU WILL HAVE TO MOVE THE VBS FILES TO A FOLDER OUTSIDE OF PROGRAM FILES IN ORDER FOR THEM TO WORK CORRECTLY. DUE TO PERMISSIONS ISSUES, THESE VBS FILES CANNOT EXECUTE IN THE PROGRAM FILES FOLDER.
